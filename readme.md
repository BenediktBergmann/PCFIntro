# PCF intro course
Welcome to this very basic intro course to [PCF (Power Apps Component Framework)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview).
The PCF gives pro devs the opportunity to create components for both Canvas- and Model-driven Apps to enhance the user experience.

There are (nearly) no boundaries to your imagination. Please take a look at the [PCF Gallery](https://pcf.gallery) to see what others have build with the PCF. All the compontents on this side are available for you to use.

This course will introduce you to the PCF. It is, as mentioned earlier, a very basic course. At the end of this course you will know the very basics of the PCF and how to build a simple PCF control yourself.

I would consider this course as a work in progress. I will add more chapters to it over time.

## Setup of the course
Every chapter has it's own folder. This folder includes a readme.md file which contains all the steps you have to perform to complete the chapter.
You will also find a folder called "DemoPCF" in (nearly) every chapter. This folder contains the code as it would be after you have completed all the steps in the readme. This means that you could take a look at the implementation if you are stuck or copy the implementation from a previous step if you would like to skip a chapter or are really stuck.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me if you have any question. Feedback is, as always, very appreciated.
